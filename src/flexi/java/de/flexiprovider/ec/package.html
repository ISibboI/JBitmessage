This package holds the provider class for the elliptic curve algorithms
<b>ECDSA</b>, <b>ECNR</b>, <b>ECDH</b> and <b>ECIES</b>. ECDSA and ECNR
are public key signature algorithms, ECDH a public key exchange protocol
and ECIES is a cipher.
<br>We will give a short introduction to how to install a JCA-based provider
and then explain some of the mathematical background of elliptic curves.
<h3>
How to install the FlexiECProvider</h3>
There are two parts to installing a provider: installing the provider package
classes, and configuring the provider.
<h5>
Installing the Provider Classes</h5>
There are a couple possible ways of installing the provider classes:
<ol>
<li>
Place a zip or JAR file containing the classes anywhere on your CLASSPATH.</li>

<li>
Supply your provider JAR file as an "installed" or "bundled" extension.</li>
</ol>

<h5>
&nbsp;Configuring the Provider</h5>
The next step is to add the provider to your list of approved providers.
This is done statically by editing the <tt>java.security</tt> file in the
l<tt>ib/security</tt> directory of the JDK. Thus, if the JDK is installed
in a directory called jdk1.2, the file would be <tt>jdk1.2/lib/security/java.security</tt>.
One of the types of properties you can set in java.security is of the following
form:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>security.provider.n=masterClassName</tt></pre>
This declares a provider, and specifies its preference order n. The preference
order is the order in which providers are searched for requested algorithms
(when no specific provider is requested). The order is 1-based; 1 is the
most preferred, followed by 2, and so on.
<br><tt>masterClassName</tt> must specify the provider's "master" class.
The provider's documentation will specify its master class. This class
is always a subclass of the Provider class. The subclass constructor sets
the values of various properties that are required for the Java Cryptography
API to look up the algorithms or other facilities implemented by the provider.
<p>Suppose that the master class is <tt>de.flexiprovider.ec.FlexiECProvider</tt>,
and that you would like to configure <tt>FlexiECProvider</tt> as your second
preferred provider. To do so, add the following line to the <tt>java.security</tt>
file:
<pre><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; security.provider.2=de.flexiprovider.ec.FlexiECProvider</tt></pre>
Providers may also be registered dynamically. To do so, call either the
addProvider or insertProviderAt method in the Security class. This type
of registration is not persistent and can only be done by "trusted" programs.

<h3>
Mathematical Background</h3>
To understand Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) one must be familiar at
least with the terms <i>group</i>, <i>finite field</i> and
<i>group</i>
or <i>element order</i>. We will give a short introduction to ECC.
<p>Let <b><i>F<sub>q</sub></i></b> be a finite field with <i>q</i> elements.
The cubic equation (Weierstra&szlig;gleichung)
<center>
<p><i>E: y<sup>2</sup>z + a<sub>1</sub> xyz + a<sub>3</sub> yz<sub>2</sub>
= x<sup>3</sup>+a<sub>2</sub> x<sup>2</sup>z + a<sub>4</sub> xz<sup>2</sup>
+ a<sub>6</sub>z<sup>3</sup></i></center>
defined over <b><i>F<sub>q</sub></i></b> is called an elliptic curve, if
it is smooth, that means, if for all points (x : y : z) of the equation
<center>
<p><i>F(x, y, z) = y<sup>2</sup>z + a<sub>1</sub> xyz + a<sub>3</sub> yz<sub>2</sub>
- x<sup>3</sup> - a<sub>2</sub> x<sup>2</sup>z - a<sub>4</sub> xz<sup>2</sup>
- a<sub>6</sub>z<sup>3</sup></i></center>
at least one of the three formal three partial differentials
<i>dF/dx</i>,
<i>dF/dy</i> and <i>dF/dz</i> is not zero.
<p>The finite fields mostly used in ECC are the <i>prime fieldsF<sub>p</sub></i>,
<i>p</i> prime, and the finite fields of characteristic 2, <i>F<sub>2<sup>m</sup></sub></i>.
With these fields our Weierstra&szlig;gleichung gets a little bit simpler:
<center>
<p><i>E: y<sup>2</sup>z = x<sup>3</sup> + axz<sup>2</sup> + bz<sup>3</sup></i></center>
for <i>x, y, z, a, b in F<sub>p</sub></i> and
<center>
<p><i>E: y<sup>2</sup>z + yz<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax<sup>2</sup>z
+ bz<sup>3</sup></i></center>
for <i>x, y, z, a, b in F<sub>2<sup>m</sup></sub></i>. Further on we will
relate only to affine coordinates.
<p>The addition of 2 points <i>R = P + Q</i> is defined as follows:
<br>Connect the points <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> by a line <i>l</i>. Then mirror
the 3. intersection of <i>l</i> with <i>E</i> at the x-axis. The resulting
intersection-point is <i>R</i>.
<br>There are two special cases:
<ol>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>P = Q</i>: When <i>P = Q</i>, the line <i>l</i> is the tangent of <i>E</i>
at the point <i>P</i>.</li>

<li>
<i>P /= Q</i>, <i>x<sub>P</sub> = x<sub>Q</sub>, y<sub>P</sub> /= y<sub>Q</sub></i>:
The line <i>l</i> will be a perpendicular through
<i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>.
Then <i>l</i> will not intersect curve <i>E</i> again. In this case we
call the resulting point <i>point at infinity</i>.</li>
</ol>
With this point addition the points on <i>E</i> together with the point
at infinity form an abelian group. Let <i>R = n*P</i>, where
<i>n*P</i>
means to add <i>P n</i>-times on itself. Then <b><i>n </i>is the discrete
logarithm of <i>R </i>to the base <i>P</i></b>. Given
<i>R</i> and <i>P</i>
it is very hard to compute <i>n</i>.
<br>The problem of computing <i>n</i> given <i>R</i> and <i>P</i> is called
the <i>discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)</i>. The security of elliptic
curve algorithms are all based on the ECDLP.
