 * This interface specifies a constraint of some ASN.1 type. Constraints are
 * called to check the validity of a type right after initialization and after
 * decoding. For instance an OCTET STRING may be defined to be at most 8 octets
 * long. This may be implemented by adding a constraint to an
 * {@link ASN1OctetString ASN1OctetString} instance that verifies the length of
 * the octets string.
